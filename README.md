# IOT_Weather_Station_using_API
This simple project demonstrates making an IoT Based Simple Weather Monitoring System using ESP8266 Wi-Fi development board and LCD Display (128 x 160).
The NodeMCY pulls weather data like temperature, humidity, pressure, location and weatherstatus from weather website called openweathermap.org and display it on LCD screen.
